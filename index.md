# Introduction and Motivation of the Project

Our Primary goal here is to give an overview of different areas of Data Science via the Video Game Sales Dataset. There are some areas which are not directly applicable here such as Reinforcement learning, these areas will be demonstrated in a more theoretical way. 

We started out with the video game sales dataset, vgsales.csv, showing some 16,000 video games by release year along with some additional attributes. Here is a detailed introduction to the dataset to start with: [Part 0: Exploratory Data Analysis](EDA_vgs.html)

We will cover 6 Topics in their separate areas as shown below, any modeling can be downloaded and explored via the jupyter notebooks that were used to generate each of the 6 individual sections.


[Part I: Data Science vs Decision Science, O-Notation, Lasso, Ridge, Graphical Models](DatavsDecision_ONot_GLMs.html)

[Part II: Tree Based Models](TreeBased Models.html)

[Part III: Bayes Universe](Bayes-Universe.html)

[Part IV: SVMs](support_vector_machines.html)

[Part V: Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement_learning.html)

[Part VI: Explainability](explainability.html)
